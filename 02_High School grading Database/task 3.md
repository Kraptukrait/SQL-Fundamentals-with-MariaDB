**🎉 Grading Database – Analyzing the Grading Data 📊**

In the first part, we developed a **data model** for the grading database and created a **MySQL script** to implement this database in MySQL. Now it's time to analyze and extract some important insights! 🕵️‍♂️

**Your Mission**:
Execute the following queries as **SELECT statements**:

1. 🧑‍🏫 **Find the average grade of student "Klapal"!** Calculate their **average** grade across all subjects.
   
2. 🏆 **Which class has the best overall average grade?** Find the class with the highest average grade! Let’s see which class is the real star ⭐.

3. 💁‍♂️💁‍♀️ **Compare the average performance of male and female students.** Are they equally awesome, or do we see any differences?

4. 📚 **For school statistics**, determine the **class size** for each class. How many students are in each class? 

5. 🕵️‍♂️ **For the new schedule**, we need to know which **teachers teach which subjects**. List the teachers and the subjects they’re responsible for! 🧑‍🏫📅

6. 🤔 **Do all teachers grade similarly?** Let’s investigate if there are any major differences in grading across teachers. 

7. 🔢 **Is there an average performance difference between classes in the subject of Mathematics?** Let’s check if any class outshines the others in Math! ✖️➗

8. 🎓 **For the upcoming promotion conference**, we need to know how many **5s and 6s** each student has. Who’s at risk of not passing? 😬

9. 🧠 **Got any additional ideas for meaningful analysis?** What other interesting insights can you discover in the grading database? Let your creativity flow!

**Have fun!** 🎉
