**🎉 Task: Grading Database Part 2 – The Mission Continues! 🏫💥**

After we’ve perfectly designed our **grading database** 🧑‍💻📚 in Part 1, it’s time to bring it to life! 🚀

**Your Mission**:
1. **Create a MySQL script** that implements our grading database in **MySQL**! 😎 Remember, you need to choose the **right field data types** to make sure everything works like a charm! 🎸💾
   
2. **Only InnoDB, baby!** 🤖 – We’ll use the **InnoDB** table type exclusively because we’re working with **relational databases**. What does that mean? 🤔 You need to make sure our tables are connected, data stays consistent, and we can perform transactions like a pro! 🏗️💡

3. **How do we handle deletions and updates?** 🔄💣 – Explain in your script how you’ll manage situations where a teacher, class, or student is deleted or updated! Which relationships should be preserved, and which ones should be deleted? A little bit of **magic logic** is required! ✨

4. **Combined keys are the key!** 🔑 In MySQL, combined keys are realized with `PRIMARY KEY (Attribute1, Attribute2, ...)`. Make sure everything fits together – almost like a puzzle 🧩!

5. **Save your SQL script** as **lastname_gradingdatabase.sql** – once you’ve done that, the **storage** will never be empty again! 💾🎉

6. **Add some sample data, test it out!** 💥🎯 Insert a few test records into your database and query them with some cool **SELECT statements**! Let’s see how it works! 🔍🤓

**Example SELECT query for your first test**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM tbl_student; 
```

**Challenge accepted?** 💪🔥 Now get started and show us what you’ve got! We want results, no excuses! 😜
