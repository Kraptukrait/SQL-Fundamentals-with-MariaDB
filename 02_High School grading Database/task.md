**📝 Exercise: Grading Database Part 1 🎓**

The last task was completed to the **utmost satisfaction** of the client! 🎉 Now, it's time for a new **mission**, bringing even more data and fun! 😎💥

**The **school management** has a big goal:**  
The **grading of all students** in the different subjects of the **High School** should be documented and analyzed with an extension of the **administration database**! 📊🎯

**Task:**
1. **Data Modeling:**  
Develop a well-thought-out **data model** that meets the requirements of the **3rd Normal Form**.  
Keep in mind:
   - **Unique field names** (no confusion! 😉) ✔️
   - **Atomic attributes** (no multiple values, only clear data! 🧠) ⚛️
   - **Unique records** (no duplicate entries! ✋) 🧮
   - **Hierarchical relationships** (who belongs to what? 🤔) 🏰

2. **Subjects** should be graded multiple times (e.g. **exams**, **participation**, **homework**, etc.). 📝🔢 The **teachers** assign the **grades** 🍎 and must enter them into our well-structured database!

3. **Goal:**  
- **Student transcripts** should be **printable**. 📜✨  
- **Average grades** for **students**, **subjects**, and more should be easy to **calculate**! 📈🧑‍🏫

The **result** will be a cool **graphical data model** with **all tables, attributes**, and **relationships**. 🖼️

**Have fun** and **good luck** with the **modeling**! 🚀💡 And remember, it should be not only logical but also neat and organized – just like a perfectly designed **transcript**! 🏆🎓
