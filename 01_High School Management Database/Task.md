### 🎓 High School Management: The Ultimate Challenge! 📚

Welcome to the most exciting mission that high school has ever seen! Our task, which we gladly accept (because we really have no choice), is to create a **management system** for students, teachers, and classes—all in SQL! 🤓💻

Imagine a perfect world where every student knows their schedule, every teacher has their students in check, and every class knows who's in charge—all powered by the magic of SQL! 🪄✨

Get ready, because we’re about to create tables, set up primary keys, and take school management to a whole new level. Let’s build a high school database that will impress even the coolest students! 🎒📘 

Are you ready for the challenge? Let’s roll up our sleeves and get started! 🎉
